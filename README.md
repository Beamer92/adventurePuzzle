Move around the levels by using the **Arrow Keys** or **WASD**
To move further in each level you must find the hidden switch to open/close hidden passageways

To search your current area for a hidden switch use the **SpaceBar**

When your area turns **Red**, you've found a switch. The **Green** tiles will be your Exit to the next room.

You can see your level and other stats in the Left side panel. Your Level and Total Score will be saved in Local Storage.

If you wish to retry a Level click the **Reset Level** button

To clear your Local Storage and go back to Level 1, click **Restart Game**


Have Fun!
